/*
TypeScript is object oriented JavaScript. TypeScript supports object-oriented programming features like classes, 
interfaces, etc. A class in terms of OOP is a blueprint for creating objects. A class encapsulates data for the object. 
Typescript gives built in support for this concept called class. JavaScript ES5 or earlier didnâ€™t support classes. 
Typescript gets this feature from ES6.
